Mandrill-GAE
============

Mandrill - PHP API - Using mandrill on GAE (Google App Engine)

If you want to use MANDRILL (https://mandrillapp.com/) to send emails using Google App Engine

Just change the Mandrill.php (from their api) to this one.

Take a look at the example (example.php).

GAE doesn't allow CURL, that's why I changed to stream (URL Fetch)

All credits to the API go to Madrill team, I just changed to make it work on GAE.
